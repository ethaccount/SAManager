# Vue Guild

- Functions should use function keyword.
- Button handlers should start with onClick, such as onClickCancel.
- Import icons from lucide-vue-next.
- The order in the script should be: state > lifecycle hooks/watchers > functions (important first, utilities last).
- Use "vueuse" utility functions, such as watchImmediate.
- There's no need to import functions from the following packages manually: ['vue', 'vue-router', 'pinia', '@vueuse/core', 'vitest'].
- There's no need to import components from @/components manually.
