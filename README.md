# Smart Account Manager

[SAManager](https://testnet.samanager.xyz/) is an open web wallet that aims to enable interoperability across different smart contract account implementations.

By leveraging ERC-4337 and various account providers, it allows users to access their smart accounts using EOAs or Passkeys to authenticate their accounts.

Smart accounts can be decentralized and are not locked into specific wallet providers. SAManager ensures your accounts remain accessible regardless of the interface you choose to use, promoting a more open and self-custodial experience.
